<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The usage of lactose sugar in Stout beer has only been happening for the last century or so.</p>
<p>Originally the idea was it would offer better nutrition for the people drinking the Stout, this has been disproven but the creaminess and overall balance of Milk Stouts have kept them relavent since the Craft Beer revolution began in the 1970s.</p>
